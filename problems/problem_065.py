# Write a function that meets these requirements.
#
# Name:       biggest_gap
# Parameters: a list of numbers that has at least
#             two numbers in it
# Returns:    the largest gap between any two
#             consecutive numbers in the list
#             (this will always be a positive number)
#
# Examples:
#     * input:  [1, 3, 5, 7]
#       result: 2 because they all have the same gap
#     * input:  [1, 11, 9, 20, 0]
#       result: 20 because from 20 to 0 is the biggest gap
#     * input:  [1, 3, 100, 103, 106]
#       result: 97 because from 3 to 100 is the biggest gap
#
# You may want to look at the built-in "abs" function


def biggest_gap(nums):
    difference = 0
    for i in range(0, len(nums)-1):
        gap = abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1])
        if gap > difference:
            difference = gap
        else:
            difference
    print(difference)


# Test Cases
print(biggest_gap([1, 3, 5, 7]))
print(biggest_gap([1, 11, 9, 20, 0]))
print(biggest_gap([1, 3, 100, 103, 106]))
